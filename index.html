  <h3>What we are doing:</h3>
  <p>Component Manufacturing in simple terms, is nothing but the process through which material undergoes transformation right from its
     basic form (cast / forged /Rolled / fabricated etc ) to finished form ( Ready
     for assembly into the machine / equipment )</p>
  <p> With ever increasing demands on productsâ€™ performance, efficiency, safety,
      robustness, reliability, longevity, compactness and eco-friendliness, the
      demand ( quality and reliability ) at component level has become even more
      stringent. This has reflected not only in design and material selection 
      but also in the type of process adopted during manufacturing.</p>
  <p> There are many ways to manufacture a component but the one that
      guarantees the desired quality, productivity with cost effectiveness is what
      every manufacturer is looking  for. From our vast experience we offer.</p>
